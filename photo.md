## 📝 Notes for Artists

### Important Considerations
- **Consistency**: All assets should feel like they belong to the same world
- **Readability**: Text must be readable against all backgrounds
- **Emotional Impact**: Visuals should reinforce the narrative mood
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: The game draws on multiple cultural linguistic traditions
- **Accessibility**: Consider colorblind-friendly palettes, high contrast options

### Iterative Development
1. Start with rough sketches/mockups
2. Get feedback on composition and mood
3. Create color studies
4. Develop final rendered assets
5. Test in-game with dialogue and UI
6. Iterate based on playtest feedback

### File Naming Convention
```
location_[name]_[variant].png
character_[name]_[emotion].png
effect_[type]_[description].png
ui_[element]_[state].png
```

**Naming Rules**:
- Use lowercase for all file names
- Use underscores (_) to separate words and components, not spaces
- Multi-word components: use underscores (e.g., `whispering_woods` not `whisperingwoods`)
- Avoid special characters except underscores
- For numbered variants, use two digits with leading zero (e.g., `_01`, `_02`)
- Keep names descriptive but concise (max 50 characters)

Examples:
- `location_ravengard_main.png` - Main background for Ravengard
- `location_whispering_woods_clearing.png` - Specific area variant
- `character_lyra_neutral.png` - Lyra's neutral expression
- `character_kaelen_dravik_angry.png` - Multi-word name with emotion
- `effect_drift_zone_swirl.png` - Drift zone effect with description
- `effect_memory_fragment_01.png` - Numbered variants
- `ui_institute_icon.png` - Faction UI element
- `ui_language_badge_verdant.png` - Specific language badge

---

## 🚀 Implementation Path

1. **Phase 1**: Core location backgrounds (replace CSS gradients)
2. **Phase 2**: Main character portraits (5 characters × 4 expressions = 20 images)
3. **Phase 3**: Special effects and overlays
4. **Phase 4**: UI elements and polish
5. **Phase 5**: Animated elements and transitions

## 📞 Questions for Art Direction

Before starting production, clarify:
- [ ] Desired art style: Realistic, anime, painterly, pixel art?
- [ ] Budget and time constraints
- [ ] Animation requirements (static images vs. animated sequences)
- [ ] Voice acting integration (lip sync needs?)
- [ ] Platform optimization (web, mobile, desktop)
- [ ] Localization plans (text in images to avoid?)
