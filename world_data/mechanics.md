## 🌀 Core Systems Overview
The game blends **visual novel branching** with **language‑driven puzzle mechanics** and **memory alteration consequences**.

---

## 1️⃣ Memory Drift System
**Definition:**  
A Memory Drift is a distortion in reality caused by unstable Ellidric glyphs.

**Player Interaction:**
- Enter Drift Zones via glyph triggers or story events
- Solve syntax puzzles to stabilize or destabilize the zone
- Choices ripple into altered memories for NPCs and the world

**Variables:**
- `drift_stability` (0–100)
- `affected_characters[]`
- `memory_fragments[]`

**Branching Impact:**
- High stability → world remains coherent, Institute gains control
- Low stability → surreal changes, Clans gain influence

---

## 2️⃣ Language Unlock System
**Definition:**  
The player learns multiple real‑world languages to interpret Ellidric differently.

**Languages & Effects:**
| Language | Unlock Effect |
|----------|---------------|
| English | Baseline translation |
| Dutch | Reveals emotional subtext |
| Latin | Unlocks ritual glyphs |
| Greek | Reveals philosophical/ethical layers |

**Mechanics:**
- `language_known[]` array determines available dialogue options
- Certain puzzles require multi‑language synthesis

---

## 3️⃣ Consequence Tracker
**Definition:**  
A persistent system that records all memory alterations and their ripple effects.

**Tracked Data:**
- `npc_loyalty[character]` (−100 to +100)
- `world_state_flags[]`
- `glyph_corruption_level` (0–5)

**Usage:**
- Alters dialogue trees
- Changes available quests
- Modifies ending conditions

---

## 4️⃣ Glyph Puzzle System
**Definition:**  
Interactive mini‑games where players arrange glyphs to form valid Ellidric phrases.

**Puzzle Types:**
- **Syntax Chains** – Arrange glyphs in correct order
- **Emotion Binding** – Match glyphs to emotional resonance
- **Memory Keys** – Combine glyphs to unlock sealed memories

**Variables:**
- `glyph_inventory[]`
- `puzzle_difficulty` (1–5)
- `time_limit` (optional)

---

## 5️⃣ Faction Influence Meter
**Definition:**  
Tracks the player’s standing with each major faction.

**Factions:**
- Institute of Lingua Arcanum
- Clans of the Whispering Woods
- The Echoborn

**Mechanics:**
- `faction_rep[faction]` (−100 to +100)
- Dialogue, quest availability, and endings shift based on standings

---

## 6️⃣ Branching Narrative Framework
**Structure:**
- **Act 1:** Introduction, first Drift Zone, language tutorial
- **Act 2:** Faction alignment choices, mid‑tier puzzles
- **Act 3:** High‑impact memory alterations, world divergence
- **Act 4:** Resolution based on Consequence Tracker + Faction Influence

**Branch Types:**
- **Faction‑Locked Routes**
- **Language‑Locked Routes**
- **Memory Outcome Routes**

---

## 7️⃣ Optional Systems
- **Glyph Crafting:** Combine fragments to create new glyphs
- **Dream Archives:** Replay altered memories to spot inconsistencies
- **Polyglot Challenges:** Timed translation puzzles for rare rewards

## Ellidric Language Mechanics

### Unlocking Dialects
- Players begin with **Codex Ellidric**.
- Dialects are unlocked via faction quests, artifacts, or linguistic puzzles.

### Gameplay Effects
- **Codex Ellidric:** Low puzzle complexity; unlocks official archives.
- **Verdant Ellidric:** Enables “Living Glyph” puzzles (glyphs shift mid‑scene).
- **Glacial Ellidric:** Enables “Light‑Shift” puzzles (rotate glyphs to reveal hidden meaning).
- **Pure Ellidric:** Requires knowledge of 2+ dialects; bypasses certain faction locks.

### Replayability Hooks
- Certain lore, routes, and endings require specific dialect combinations.
- Mastery of all dialects unlocks **Proto‑Ellidric** fragments, revealing hidden world events.

### Cross‑Faction Synergy
- Combining dialects in dialogue can persuade, deceive, or unlock hybrid magic.
